# NLP Practice Work

NLP aims to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding.

NLP involves various tasks such as:

* Text Classification: Assigning labels or categories to text documents.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities such as names, dates, and * locations in text.
* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text.
* Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries of longer text documents.
* Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
* Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.
* Question Answering: Generating answers to user questions based on a given text.
* Chatbots: Creating conversational agents that can interact with users in natural language.


Key Concepts and Techniques in NLP:

* Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units, such as words or sentences.
* Part-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to words in a sentence.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and categorizing entities like names, dates, and locations.
* Word Embedding: Representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space.
* Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
* Bag of Words (BoW): Representing text as a vector of word frequencies.
* TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure of word importance in a document.
* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in text (positive, negative, neutral).
* Language Models: Models trained to predict the next word in a sequence of words, used for text generation.
